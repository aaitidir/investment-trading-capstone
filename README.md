## Motivations

Stock market have always been difficult to predict and even the most brilliant mind of all times had difficulties with the markets

Newton allegedly said that he could “calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.” 1

 
Stock Market prices are not only defined by companies fundamentals. Human behaviour can alter the true value of a company. The valuation of a company can be understood in two well defined kind of analyses the fundamental and the technical. 

For our project we will focus on technical analysis and explore daily data provided by Yahoo about companies and  try to predict the Adj Close.
